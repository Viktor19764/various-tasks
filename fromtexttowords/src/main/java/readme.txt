Classes allow you to convert the text into a list of words, then add a list translated manually, and then combine the two lists into a combined list that you can import into the program ANKI and teach the words, and then read the book.
Good way!

1. Add text to file, save it in directory "java".
2. Run java workwithtext/Main <name of file with text>
2. Take words from file "words.txt", manually translate this words, in Google or other, save to file "onlyTranslation.txt".
3. Run java workwithtext/MainToCsv

Your result file is "wordswithtranslation.txt"!
